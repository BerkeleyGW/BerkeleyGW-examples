Bulk silicon from Empirical Pseudopotential Method (EPM) mean-field code
========================================================================

This example shows how to run a calculation on bulk Si using EPM, which is
provided with BerkeleyGW. No external mean-field code is required. This
example can be run all in serial.

Remember to modify each script before launching it!

1. Generate k-points (directory 0)
Customize and run:
./script_0.sh

2. Create symbolic links
Customize and run:
./script_1.sh

3. Generate wavefunction files (directories 1 to 5)
You must manually add the k-points to EPM input files (directories 1 to 5).
In this example, however, we did that for you already.
Customize and run:
./script_2.sh

4. Run GW and BSE calculations (directories 6 to 9)
We will:
- Generate dielectric matrix (directory 6)
- Calculate self-energy corrections (directory 7)
- Generate electron-hole interaction kernel (directory 8)
- Solve BSE and calculate optical absorption (directory 9)

Customize and submit/run:
./script_3.sh

This script can be run in serial, and takes about 5 mins.

5. You can view the absorption spectrum with and without electron-hole
interactions by plotting the files 9-absorption/absorption_eh.dat and
9-absorption/absorption_noeh.dat, respectively.
