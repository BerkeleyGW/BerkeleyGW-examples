     Parallel version (MPI), running on    64 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     K-points division:     npool     =       4
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      16

     Reading data from directory:
     ./cspbcl3.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PBE ( 1  4  3  4 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
