Bulk CsPbCl3 (cubic phase) with spin-orbit coupling (By Yinan Chen and Marina Filip, 04/2021)
============

This example shows how to run a calculation on bulk CsPbCl3 including
the spin-orbit coupling with Quantum ESPRESSO.
Note, all mean-field calculations are performed with QE6.4 and all pseudopotentials are taken
from Pseudo Dojo.

In this example, we compute the quasiparticle eigenvalues and optical absorption spectrum 
of bulk CsPbCl3.  Note all parameters are significantly underconverged.

Please follow the same steps as for the silicon_SOC example - note that in this calculation 
we use the momentum rather than the velocity matrix elements, and therefore we do not use 
a shifted fine grid.
