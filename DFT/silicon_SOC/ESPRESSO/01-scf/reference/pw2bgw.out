     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on      32 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                32
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      32

     Reading data from directory:

     Message from routine read_upf::
     Pseudo file Si_FR.UPF has been fixed on the fly.
To avoid this message in the future, permanently fix 
 your pseudo files following these instructions:

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PZ ( 1  1  0  0 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
