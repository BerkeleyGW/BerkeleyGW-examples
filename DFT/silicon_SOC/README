Bulk silicon with spin-orbit coupling (By Meng Wu, 04/2021)
============

This example shows how to run a calculation on bulk Si including
the spin-orbit coupling with Quantum ESPRESSO.

In this example, we compute the optical absorption spectrum of bulk Si and
plot the GW quasiparticle bandstructure. We show how to use inteqp
to produce an interpolated quasiparticle bandstructure.

1. Enter your mean-field directory (ESPRESSO).
Read, customize and run/submit all scripts in that folder in the alphabetic order
they appear.

2. Go back to the directory containing this file, and modify/submit `script_3`.
Suggested 1 node [32s for epsilon, 160s for sigma, 3s for inteqp]
We will:
- Generate dielectric matrix (directory 07-epsilon)
- Calculate self-energy corrections (directory 08-sigma)
- Interpolate quasiparticle bandstructure (directory 09-inteqp)

3. Modify/submit `script_4`.
Suggested 20 node [500s for kernel, 900s for absorption]
- Generate electron-hole interaction kernel (directory 10-kernel)
- Solve BSE and calculate optical absorption (directory 11-absorption)
