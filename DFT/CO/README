CO molecule
===========

This example shows how to run a calculation on a CO molecule.
A similar calculation may be found in:

Remember to modify each script before launching it!


1. Enter your mean-field directory of choice (ESPRESSO or PARATEC).
Read, customize and run/submit all scripts in that folder in the alphabetic order
they appear.


2. Go back to the directory containing this file, and modify/submit `script`.
Suggested 1 node (tested with ncpu = 24, walltime = 00:05:00).
We will:
- Generate dielectric matrix (directory 3)
- Calculate self-energy corrections (directory 4)
- Generate electron-hole interaction kernel (directory 5)
- Solve BSE and calculate optical absorption (directory 6)

3. You can plot the optical absorption spectrum following the same
strategy presented in the silicon example.
