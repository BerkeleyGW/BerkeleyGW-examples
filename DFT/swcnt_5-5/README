(5,5) metallic singled-wall carbon nanotube
===========================================

This example shows how to run a calculation on the (5,5) metallic single-wall
carbon nanotube starting with either Quantum ESPRESSO or PARATEC for the mean-
field calculation.  We compute the GW quasiparticle corrections and the optical
absorption by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation.  We suggest you run the
silicon and sodium examples before you ran this one.


To run this example, follow the steps below.  Remember to modify each script
before launching it!


1. Enter your mean-field directory of choice (ESPRESSO, PARATEC, or ABINIT).
Read, customize and run/submit all scripts in that folder in the alphabetic order
they appear.  Note that we override the occupations in pp_in.  Quantum ESPRESSO
gives non-integer occupations for metals that may round to the incorrect
occupations. Suggested 1 node (tested with ncpu = 32, walltime = 00:30:00).


2. Go back to the directory containing this file, and modify/submit script_3.
Suggested 1 node (tested with ncpu = 32, walltime = 00:20:00).
We will:
- Generate dielectric matrix (directories 4 and 5)
- Calculate self-energy corrections (directory 6)
- Generate electron-hole interaction kernel (directory 7)
- Solve BSE and calculate optical absorption (directory 8)

You can plot the optical absorption specturm in
`8-absorption/absorption_eh.dat` and `8-absorption/absorption_noeh.dat`
