This example provides the basic templates for ABINIT.

Inside the directories you will find:

basic.in:
This is a file containing the basic informations 
of the system, such as crystal structure, energy-cutoff, etc.
This information is repeated on every step of the calculation.
So, this is simpler to copy this file at each time.

in, files, *fhi:
These are the input files, and pseudopotential files.
Please refer to: www.abinit.org for an explanation.

abi2bgw.in:
Input file for the ABINIT-to-BGW wrapper.
For the moment it does not have a proper parser. 
So do not change rows or add more lines to this.
This follows the spirit of pw2bgw.in.

./get-kpts-wk.sh:
Script to get k-points and weights (kpt.in and wtk.in) from output files in 00-kgrid

Run it as follows:
./script_0
./script_1
./script_2
