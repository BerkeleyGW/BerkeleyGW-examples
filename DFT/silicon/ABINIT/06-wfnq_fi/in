#NSCF general template for ABINIT:

#Definition of the method
iscf -3 #NSCF :use -3 to use weights given explicitely (see below)
tolwfr 1.d-13 #tolerance threshold 
nband 5 #Number of bands
nbdbuf 1 #high energy bands difficult to converge, better skip them
nline 6 #Usually this is better for NSCF calculations

#Uncomment these two if using MPI-IO:
#autoparal   1   #To let ABINIT decide over parallelization options 
#accesswff   1   #read/write files using mpi-io
#npband      1         #Try to avoid paralelizing over bands, as sometimes can be problematic, this will force the code to paralelize over spin,kpoits and ffts only.

#I/O options
irdden 1        #Read density
 prtwf 1        #Print wavefunctions
prtden 0        #Do not print density
getwfk 0            #Start wavefunctions from scratch

# k-point sampling
istwfk   *1
kptopt    0        #Give the k-points explicitly
include "kpt.in"   #k-points given in an external file

#weights
include "wtk.in"   #k-weights given in an external file

#Basic information: unit-cell, atoms, cutoffs, etc..
include "basic.in"
