Bulk silicon
============

This example shows how to run a calculation on bulk Si using SCAN functional with
the usage of KIH energy by Quantum ESPRESSO. The interface code pw2bgw.x to use the
KIH energy is provided by BGW-3.0. You can find it in the folder 
'BerkeleyGW-3.0/MeanField/ESPRESSO/version-6.4'. Please compile your Quantum ESPRESSO
of the corresponding version with the pw2bgw.f90 provided in these folder. Also remember
to compile your Quantum ESPRESSO with libxc.

In this example, we compute and plot the GW quasiparticle bandstructure of bulk Si.
We interpolate QP corrections using the inteqp code, since it's very stable,
fast, and easy to use.

Note: the reference values were obtained with the Quantum ESPRESSO mean-field
code. Other mean-field codes will produces energies which should differ by
at most 10 meV.

Remember to modify each script before launching it!


1. Enter the ESPRESSO mean-field directory.
Read, customize and run/submit all scripts in that folder in the alphabetic order
they appear. Remember to specify a path of qe version 6.4 compiled with libxc in 
'script_2'


2. Go back to the directory containing this file, and modify/submit `script_3`.
Suggested 1 node (tested with ncpu = 32, walltime = 00:30:00).
We will:
- Generate dielectric matrix (directory 7)
- Calculate self-energy corrections (directory 8)


3. Here, we plot the GW bandstructure using the inteqp code.
You should edit and submit `script_4`, and the resulting bandstructure
will be saved to `09-inteqp/bandstructure_inteqp.pdf`.
You must have python/matplotlib to run this step.
