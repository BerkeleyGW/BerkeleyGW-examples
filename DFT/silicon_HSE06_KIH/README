Bulk silicon
============

This example shows how to run a calculation on bulk Si using a hybrid functional (HSE06) with
the usage of KIH energy by Quantum ESPRESSO. The use of KIH is compatible with any general 
functionals (LDA, GGA, metaGGA and hybrid functionals) so that one can do the GW-BSE
calculation starting from DFT calculation with those functionals. The interface code 
pw2bgw.x to use the KIH energy is provided by BGW-3.0. You can find it in the folder 
'BerkeleyGW-3.0/MeanField/ESPRESSO/version-6.7'. Please compile your Quantum ESPRESSO
of the corresponding version with the pw2bgw.f90 provided in these folder.

Note that unlike most GW MF calculations, each MF calc with a hybrid starting point is
done as an scf calculation. This is because GKS hamiltonians depend on the density AND
orbitals of your eigensystem so changing the kgrid is not easily done. It is possible
to incease the number of unoccupied bands so long as a converged density and set of occupied 
is provided to initialize the GKS hamiltonisn, and this can be achived with some amount of 
modification to the QE code but we do not do so in this example.

In this example, we compute and plot the GW quasiparticle bandstructure of bulk Si.

Note: the reference values were obtained with the Quantum ESPRESSO mean-field
code. Other mean-field codes will produces energies which should differ by
at most 10 meV.

Remember to modify each script before launching it!


1. Enter the ESPRESSO mean-field directory.
Read, customize and run/submit all scripts in that folder in the alphabetic order
they appear. Remember to specify a path of qe version 6.7 with the KIH version of
pw2bgw.x in 'script_2'


2. Go back to the directory containing this file, and modify/submit `script_3`.
Suggested 1 node (tested with ncpu = 32, walltime = 00:10:00).
We will:
- Generate dielectric matrix (directory 7)
- Calculate self-energy corrections (directory 8)
