     Parallel version (MPI), running on    64 processors
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      64

   Info: using nr1, nr2, nr3 values from input

   Info: using nr1s, nr2s, nr3s values from input

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = SLA+PW ( 1 4 0 0 0)
     EXX-fraction              =        0.00
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
