# Sample output from each run, generated based on ESPRESSO DFT input, is
# in each directory of the GW/BSE calculations, for comparison.
#
# Enter ESPRESSO directory.
# cd ./ESPRESSO
#
# run scf, generate rho and vxc
# Submit qscript_1. Suggested ncpu = 144, walltime = 1:00:00
#
# generate wavefunctions
# Submit qscript_2. Suggested ncpu = 3136, walltime = 2:00:00
#
# Return to ZnO directory.
# cd ..
#
# generate dielectric matrix
# Submit qscript_3. Suggested ncpu = 2304, walltime = 3:00:00
#
# calculate self-energy corrections
# Submit qscript_4. Suggested ncpu = 2048, walltime = 12:00:00
#
# interpolate quasiparticle band structure
# Submit qscript_5. Suggested ncpu = 16, walltime = 0:30:00
#
# plot the results
# Run plot_Zn2O2_epsinv.py and plot_Zn2O2_band.py
