     Parallel version (MPI), running on   512 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     8 nodes
     K-points division:     npool     =      32
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      16
     Reading input from scf.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Message from routine cell_base_init:
     DEPRECATED: use true lattice parameter, not A to a.u. conversion factor
     Message from routine read_pp_mesh:
     mesh size missing, using the one in header

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
