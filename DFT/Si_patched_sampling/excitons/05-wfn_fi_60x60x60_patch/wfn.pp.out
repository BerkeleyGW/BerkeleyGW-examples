     Parallel version (MPI), running on   128 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     8 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =     128

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./Si.save/
     Message from routine read_pp_mesh:
     mesh size missing, using the one in header

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE
                           (   1   4   3   4   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
