Here we will perform a GW-BSE for the exciton binding energy of Silicon, and compare the values we get from sampling
the entire Brillouin zone using a 20x20x20 grid, and from sampling a small region around Gamma, drawn from a 100x100x100
grid, with a cutoff of 0.09 around Gamma in crystal coordinates. 

The mean field, GW and kernel calculations have already been run for you, and you will simply need to use their outputs. 

Proceed into the excitons directory and follow instructions there for the next steps.
